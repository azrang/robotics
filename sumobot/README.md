Sumo Robotics is a form of autonomous robot combat where the objective is to push the opposing robot out of a ring mimicking the sport of sumo.  The idea of Sumo Robotics originated from the traditional sport of sumo wrestling in Japan. In this sport, two competitors aim to force each other out of a ring or get the other to touch the ground with a part of their body other than the sole of their feet. Then in the 1990s, robotics enthusiasts started creating mini robots capable of engaging in sumo matches. These matches mimicked the dynamics of traditional sumo wrestling, but just with robots. Today, sumo robotics have advanced as the popularity of these competitions has skyrocketed. It ranges from being used as an educational tool to international competitions. 


The materials of the competition should stay within the $200 budget. Parts were priced based on unit price of manufacturer price. The size of the sumo robot should be within the 10”x10”x6” size limit and 5 lbs weight. The motors chosen may not have more than a 3A stall current and the  power supply no more than 14V. The robot will be programmed by the ATMega328P. There will be IR sensors to aid the robot in sensing the ring and other robots. Overall, the goal of the competition was to build a working robot that can be autonomously controlled. The robot must push the other robot out of the ring without leaving
